Main features:
Edited 2 layouts:
"homelayoutcomponent"- I created a new layout component adding a Navbar, footer and a features component. This had to be done because the initial page I was building was the products page and not the initial home page. I assumed it was due to the abundance of info on that page 
"productlayoutcomponent"- This used to be the home page now is a seperate page layout. Created hero components along with two card components
Created 1 new layout:
"ourteamcomponent"- I routed a navbar link to this page. Created our team cards using 2 attributes name and position
Using links throughout the home page I constructed 3 routes to those layouts

Will be refactoring to better code functionality
